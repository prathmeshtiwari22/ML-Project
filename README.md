# Fashion Shop Analysis with Decision Tree (Python Jupyter Notebook)

## Introduction

The Fashion Shop Analysis project is a Python Jupyter Notebook-based analysis that focuses on determining the effectiveness of online ad boosts for a fashion shop. This project utilizes data analysis, data visualization, decision tree modeling, and predictive analytics to assess whether ad boosts have a significant impact on sales.

## Features

- **Data Analysis:** Explore and analyze the provided dataset to gain insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and ad boost effects.

- **Data Visualization:** Utilize data visualization techniques to represent data in a clear and understandable manner, helping in the identification of patterns and trends.

- **Decision Tree Modeling:** Implement a decision tree model to predict the effectiveness of ad boosts based on various features.

- **Accuracy Assessment:** Evaluate the accuracy of the decision tree model to determine its reliability in predicting the impact of ad boosts.

- **Predictions:** Use the decision tree model to predict the effectiveness of ad boosts on new input data.

## Requirements

- Python: You should have Python installed on your system.

- Jupyter Notebook: Install Jupyter Notebook to open and run the project.

- Required Libraries: Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. You can install them using pip.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the project's `.ipynb` file from the Jupyter Notebook interface.

5. Run the project cells to perform data analysis, data visualization, decision tree modeling, and predictions.

## Usage

1. Follow the project steps and explanations provided within the Jupyter Notebook file.

2. Examine the data analysis and visualizations to gain insights into the fashion shop's performance and ad boost effects.

3. Utilize the decision tree model to assess the impact of ad boosts based on input data.

4. Review the accuracy of the decision tree model's predictions to determine its reliability.

5. Use the model for predictions on new data to evaluate the effectiveness of potential ad boosts.
